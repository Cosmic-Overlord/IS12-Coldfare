<h2>RULES</h2>
<ol type="1">
  <li><b>Admin has the final say in everything</b></li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>This means you can be banned "without good reason".</li>
      <li>Sometimes we have to take actions for the common good even if a rule has not been broken. So behave yourself.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Do not grief</b></li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>This means don't purposely fuck up things for your team mates.</li>
      <li>This also includes killing your team mates for no reason. We will know if you did.</li>
    </ol>
  
  <li><b>No toxic behavior</b></li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>This includes offensive slurs of all kind, racial or bigotted, as well as racist remarks in general. There are other servers where you can share you hatred of "niggers", "faggots" and "the jews". This isn't one of those servers.</li>
      <li>This also includes being a generally unlikeable and assholish person in the OOC. War sucks. You'll die alot. Refrain from constantly bitching about it.</li>
    </ol>
  
  <li><b>Do not break the atmosphere of the round</b></li>
    <ol type="i"> 
      <li>Do not use internet speak or lingo, and try to avoid referencing current events.</li>
      <li>Silly names are allowed but only as nicknames. John "Red Killer" Smith is allowed. John Redkiller is not.</li>
    </ol>
	
  <li><b>Listen to your superiors</b></li>
    <ol type="i"> 
      <li>Follow the chain of command. When your commanding officer tells you to die then you die.</li>
    </ol>
  
  <li><b>Have fun</b></li>
    <ol type="i"> 
      <li>You are going to die a lot. You are going to spend a lot of time moaning in agony in the middle of no man's land with no one around to save you. Try not to let it get to you. War is heck, things rarely go as planned. Circumstances out of your control will lead to your death. Keep your chin up soldier and die for the glory of your team!</li>
    </ol>
